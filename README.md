# SemanticRAG 

SemanticRAG is a pipeline application designed to process, translate, and analyze textual data for community-driven insights. Leveraging a dataset of posts in diverse languages, this project integrates data retrieval and semantic chunking with translation workflows to enhance contextual understanding and accessibility.

Features
Language Translation: Translates non-English posts into English using state-of-the-art language models.
Semantic Chunking: Breaks down translated text into semantically coherent units for easier interpretation and processing.
Scalable Processing: Handles large volumes of textual data with efficient, automated workflows.
Tools and Technologies
Development Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook
NLP Framework: Custom-built translation and semantic chunking modules
Data Management: Pandas for structured handling of datasets
How It Works
Data Preparation:

Loads textual data from a user-provided dataset.
Prepares and cleans the data for translation and analysis.
Language Translation:

Utilizes advanced translation tools to convert posts into English, ensuring minimal loss of context.
Semantic Chunking:

Analyzes the translated text to extract meaningful semantic units.
Provides chunked outputs for better interpretability and further insights.
Output:

Generates translated content with semantic chunks to visualize and analyze trends, sentiments, or specific topics.
Workflow Overview
Input: Raw textual data in its original language.
Processing:
Translate to English.
Segment translated text into semantic chunks.
Output: Structured insights combining translated text and semantic analysis.
